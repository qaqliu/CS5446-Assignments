1. AI draft check
   Assumption or invariant examined:
   Smallest counterexample tested:
   Revision made, if any:

2. Fragment 1 (loading while the door may be closed)
    `Violated Invariant` - It is stated that a passenger can only enter / exit the elevator when the door is open at their starting / destination level.  
    `Counter Example` - When the elevator with a closed door and person1 are both at level 1, the person1 will be able to enter the elevator with this action in Fragment 1.  
    `Minimal Repair` - Adds a check for the door state to be true in the precondition.   
    ```lisp
    :precondition (and (elevator_at ?l) (person_at ?p ?l) (elevator_empty) (door_open ?l))
    ```

3. Fragment 2 (incorrect movement effect)
    `Violated Invariant` - The update of the elevator is wrong. After the action, the elevator should be at ?to level, and removed from ?from level.  
    `Counter Example` - Assume the current state is that the elevator is at level1 and take the action of moving up to level2. The effect remove the elevator from level2 and asserts elevator to be at level1.  
    `Minimal Repair` - Swap the variables in the effect to reflect the reality.
    ```lisp
    :effect (and (not (elevator_at ?from)) (elevator_at ?to))
    ```

4. Fragment 3 (using each passenger's start as the goal)
    `Violated Invariant` - The target condition for a successful plan must evaluate whether passengers have reached their requested destinations.  
    `Counter Example` -  A configuration requires person1 to travel from level2 to level0. Because the fragment writes level{start} into the goal block, the required end state is set to (person_at person1 level2). The planner will immediately terminate with zero actions since the goal is already satisfied in the initial state.  
    `Minimal Repair` - Use the reference {start} instead of {goal}  

5. Capacity extension
   Q1: Why the unload count-link direction decrements occupancy: 
   A1: It decrements the occupancy since unload moves one step backward along the occupancy
   chain (from a higher count to a lower count), transitioning from " ?current to the lower ?previous "
   reduces the number of passengers currently in the elevator.
   
   Q2: What can happen if load omits (not (reached ?p)): 
   A2: It means that the passenger who has reached the destination can board the elevator again, creating
   a infinite action of the passenger boarding and exiting at the same level. This might make it impossible 
   to reach the end state.
